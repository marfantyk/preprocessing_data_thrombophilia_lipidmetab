rs328	LPL	C	G	G	The LPL gene provides instructions for making the enzyme lipoprotein lipase, which breaks down fats in the body. To be precise it is responsible for the hydrolysis of triglycerides and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL).  A particular variant of the LPL gene, called rs328, has been studied for its potential associations with various health conditions. This SNP is also called LPL 1595C>G or LPL Ser447X. The S447X mutation is a variant in the LPL (lipoprotein lipase) gene that results in a deficiency of functional LPL enzyme. This mutation has been associated with impaired lipid metabolism and an increased risk of certain metabolic disorders. Individuals with the S447X mutation may have high levels of triglycerides in their blood, which can increase the risk of pancreatitis and other health problems. This mutation may also increase the risk of developing coronary artery disease, a condition in which the arteries that supply blood to the heart become narrowed or blocked. The S447X mutation is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, which means that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to have the condition. Individuals with only one copy of the mutated gene are called carriers and do not typically have any symptoms or health problems related to the mutation. It's important to note that the impact of the S447X mutation on lipid metabolism and the risk of metabolic disorders can vary depending on other genetic and environmental factors.

rs268	LPL	A	G	G	LPL is an enzyme that plays a key role in the breakdown and utilization of fats in the body. rs268, also known as LPL Asn291Ser as well as LPL N291S or N318S, a SNP in the lipoprotein lipase LPL gene, has been linked to increased susceptibility to hypertriglyceridemia, heart disease, Type-2 diabetes, idiopathic venous thromboembolism. This mutation has been shown to alter LPL activity and increase the risk of hypertriglyceridemia, a condition characterized by high levels of triglycerides in the blood. It's important to note that the impact of the N291S mutation on lipid metabolism and the risk of metabolic disorders can vary depending on other genetic and environmental factors.

rs708272	CETP	G	A	G	Cholesteryl ester transfer protein, encoded by CETP, plays a key role in the metabolism of high-density lipoproteins (HDL). rs708272, also known as the TaqIB polymorphism of the CETP gene, may influence the levels of the "good" cholesterols, the high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterols. It mediates the exchange of lipids between lipoproteins, resulting in the eventual uptake of cholesterol by hepatocytes (reverse cholesterol transport). High plasma CETP concentration is associated with reduced HDL concentrations and is a strong and independent risk factor for CAD.  Generally, the B2 allele (A-allele) is considered to lead to higher HDL levels, associated with reduced plasma CETP levels, and reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. Meta-analysis [PMID: 27608031] has shown that  CETP TaqIB polymorphism protects against composite ischemic CVD risk and is associated with a higher HDL-C concentration in both Asians and Caucasians.

rs429358	APOE	T	C	C	Apolipoprotein E is encoded by the APOE gene, which plays a key role in lipid transport and metabolism and is essential in cholesterol homeostasis. Two SNPs lead to the formation of three APOE isoforms, E2, E3 and E4. Polymorphisms in APOE gene has been linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD), immunoregulation, cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), as well as infectious diseases. Carriers of the E4 allele tend to exhibit an increased risk for the above-mentioned chronic diseases. APOE E4 carriers may be more responsive to their external environment, where focusing on decreasing environmental stressors and pollution, ensuring quantity and quality of dietary fat is addressed, and increasing intake of phytonutrient rich foods, as well as including sufficient exercise, may prove beneficial in negating the effects of the SNP.

rs7412	APOE	C	T	C	The APOE gene provides instructions for making a protein called apolipoprotein E. This protein plays a role in the metabolism of lipids (fats) in the body, specifically in the transport of cholesterol and other fats in the blood. There are three different versions (alleles) of the APOE gene: E2, E3, and E4. Each person inherits one copy of the APOE gene from each parent, so an individual can have two copies of the same allele (such as E2/E2 or E4/E4) or one copy of each (such as E3/E4). The specific combination of alleles that an individual has can influence their risk of developing certain health conditions. Research has suggested that E4 allele is  linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD), immunoregulation, cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), as well as infectious diseases. Carriers of the E4 allele tend to exhibit an increased risk for the above-mentioned chronic diseases. Individuals with the E2 allele may have a lower risk of these conditions. APOE E4 carriers may be more responsive to their external environment, where focusing on decreasing environmental stressors and pollution, ensuring quantity and quality of dietary fat is addressed, and increasing intake of phytonutrient rich foods, as well as including sufficient exercise, may prove beneficial in negating the effects of the SNP.

rs6544713	ABCG8	T	C	T	The ABCG8 gene provides instructions for making a protein called ATP-binding cassette transporter G8. This protein is involved in the transport of cholesterol and other lipids within cells, and it plays a role in the regulation of lipid levels in the body. Studies have suggested that the ABCG8 protein may be involved in the breakdown of cholesterol in the liver and the removal of excess cholesterol from the body. Variations in the ABCG8 gene may be associated with changes in cholesterol metabolism and an increased risk of certain health conditions, such as hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol) and cardiovascular disease. This SNP is associated with an increased risk of Coronary Artery Disease, Carotid Artery Disease, Ischemic Stroke and Diabetes. 	[PMID: 30926973];	European; African; Asian; Latin American;	
rs7679	PCIF1	T	C	C	The PCIF1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called PCI domain-containing family 1 protein. This protein is involved in the regulation of lipid (fat) metabolism and energy homeostasis in the body. Studies have suggested that the PCIF1 protein may be involved in the breakdown and storage of fats, as well as in the regulation of cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the blood. Variations in the PCIF1 gene may be associated with changes in lipid metabolism and an increased risk of certain health conditions, such as obesity and metabolic syndrome.

rs2650000	HNF1A-AS1	A	C	A	The HNF1A-AS1 gene provides instructions for making a noncoding RNA molecule called HNF1A antisense RNA 1. Noncoding RNAs do not provide instructions for making proteins, but they play important regulatory roles in the body. The function of HNF1A-AS1 is not fully understood, but research has suggested that it may play a role in lipid (fat) metabolism and energy homeostasis in the body.

rs471364	TTC39B	C	T	C	The tetratricopeptide repeat domain 39B gene (TTC39B), also known as C9orf52, a high density lipoprotein (HDL) gene discovered in human genome wide association studies (GWASes). 	[PMID 21738485];  [PMID 19951432]; [PMID: 19060906];	European;	
rs1800961	HNF4A	C	T	T	HNF4A (Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha) is a transcription factor that plays a key role in the regulation of hepatic (liver) gene expression. HNF4A has been shown to be involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism, specifically the synthesis and metabolism of cholesterol and lipoproteins in the liver. HNF4A has also been linked to the development of metabolic disorders such as diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Mutations in the HNF4A gene have been associated with an increased risk of developing these disorders.	[PMID: 24097068]; [PMID: 18660489]; [PMID: 30698716];	European;	
rs5128	APOC3	G	C	G	APOC3 is a protein that plays an important role in lipid metabolism. It inhibits lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase, two enzymes responsible for fat catabolism. A positive correlation has been observed between raised plasma APOC3 levels and elevated levels of plasma triglycerides, indicating that APOC3 can be a relevant predictor of dietary low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) response.

rs2967605	RAB11B	C	T	T	RAB11B is a member of the RAB family of small GTPases, which play a role in intracellular membrane transport. RAB11B has been shown to be involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism, specifically the recycling of endocytosed lipoproteins in the lysosome. Dysregulation of RAB11B has been linked to the development of various diseases, including obesity and diabetes. 	[PMID: 29507422];	European;	
rs6756629	ABCG8, ABCG5	G	A	G	ABCG5/ABCG8 are key in regulating whole-body sterol trafficking, by eliminating sterols via the biliary tree as well as the intestinal tract. ABCG5/ABCG8 are genetically associated with lipid levels and downstream atherosclerotic disease, as well as formation of gallstones and the risk of gallbladder cancer.

rs676210	APOB	G	A	G	Encodes the apolipoprotein B protein, which is a major component of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Mutations in this gene have been associated with high LDL cholesterol levels and an increased risk of heart disease. Apolipoprotein B (apoB), a key component of VLDL particles and microsomal triacylglycerol transfer protein (MTP), plays an important role in lipid metabolism. Reduced secretion of apoB protein can result in reduced production of chylomicron and VLDL and then leading to malabsorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins. This SNP was shown to affect atorvastatin response among Iraqi population: in response to 40 mg/day of atorvastatin therapy, the minor allele (A) observed a greater LDL-C lowering than the wild type allele (G) [PMID: 34156559]. This SNP was shown to have association with Acute Coronary Syndrome in Mexican population [PMID: 35440891].	[PMID: 26629186]; [PMID: 34156559]; [PMID: 23247145]	European, Chinese;	
rs12740374	CELSR2	G	A	G	CELSR2 and PSRC1 are mapped to the same locus as the SORT1 gene. The SORT1 gene encodes sortilin which is involved in the cholesterol homeostasis in humans. Sortilin increases the hepatic output of VLDL which acts as a precursor for LDL in plasma. GWAS study showed minor allele is associated with increased LDL [PMID: 18262040]; Pharmacogenetic meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of LDL cholesterol response to statins found each minor allele to increase statin effectiveness [PMID: 25350695];	[PMID: 18262040]; [PMID: 25350695]; [PMID: 28577571];	European; African;	
rs17145738	TBL2	C	T	T	The TBL2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called tubulin beta-like 2. This protein is involved in the structure and function of cells in the body, and it plays a role in the regulation of lipid (fat) metabolism. Studies have suggested that the TBL2 protein may be involved in the breakdown of fats in the body and in the regulation of the levels of cholesterol and other lipids in the blood. rs17145738 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the TBL2 gene. Some research has suggested that this variant may be associated with an increased risk of developing dyslipidemia, a condition characterized by abnormal levels of lipids (such as cholesterol and triglycerides) in the blood. Dyslipidemia is a major risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease, and it is often treated with lifestyle changes and medications to lower lipid levels. GWAS have shown the association of G-allele with the increase of triglyceride level. 	[PMID 18193044]; [PMID 20686565] 	European
