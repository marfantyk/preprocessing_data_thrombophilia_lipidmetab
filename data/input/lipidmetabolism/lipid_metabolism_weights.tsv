rs268	AG	-0,5	You are heterozygous carrier of the N291S (rs268) mutation, it means that you have one copy of the mutated gene and one copy of the normal gene. Carriers of the N291S mutation may not have any symptoms or health problems related to the mutation. However, it is important to be aware of the potential impact of the N291S mutation on lipid metabolism and the risk of metabolic disorders. Some research have shown heterozygous carriers have an increased risk of  venous thromboembolism [PMID 16651467]	A	G	G	G	alt	het
rs268	GG	-1	GG genotype carriers may have a decreased activity of LPL and increased risk for venous thromboembolism (3x increased according to the [PMID 16651467]). This genotype is a risk factor for dyslipidemia, characterized by hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL-C levels. This LPL gene variant predisposes to more severe dyslipidemia with increasing age and weight gain [PMID: 16741292]. It's important to note that the impact of the rs268 mutation on lipid metabolism and the risk of metabolic disorders can vary depending on other genetic and environmental factors. 	A	G	G	G	alt	hom
